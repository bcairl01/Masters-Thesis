			I would like to thank Professor Farshad Khorrami for his advisement throughout the course of this project, as well as for his help in guiding my path of study in the fields of controls and robotics during my career as a BS/MS student. The knowledge and skills I have gained under Professor Khorrami's advisement will be invaluable to my future work and continued learning. %I also thank Professor Khorrami the time he spent helping me revise papers and discussing each stage of my project. My time under his advisement has given me a wealth of insight about controls, robotics, and research.
