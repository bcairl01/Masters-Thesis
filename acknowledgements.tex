			I would like to thank Professor Farshad Khorrami for his advisement throughout the course of this project, as well as for teaching me various elements of controls and robotics knowledge necessary for completing the work I have done up to this point. Professor Khorrami has helped guide me toward learning a set of skills and a base of knowledge which will be invaluable to my future work. I also thank Professor Khorrami for all the time he spent helping me to revise papers and discuss the different portions of my project with me. My time under his advisement has given me a wealth of insight about controls, robotics, research and scientific report writing in the academic setting.

			I would also like to thank Dr. Krishnamurthy for his guidance in various implementation matters, including with matters of programming and discussing solutions to particular problems which were faced during the course of my work. Additionally, I would like to thank my colleague Griswald Brooks for countless instances of assistance with hardware-related matters during the design and construction of my robot.
